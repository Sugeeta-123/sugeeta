        <h2>All about me</h2>
        <img id="pic" src="IMG_9999.jpg" >
        <p id="bio">My favorite food is ice cream. My favorite activity is playing Roblox. On sunny days, I like riding my bike. 
            There are four people in my family, including me. My favorite family member is my brother, though he is really 
            annoying at times! Haha! I go to a school called Bon Meade Elementary School. 
            I haven't had too many chances to participate, but my most prized is Battle of the Books. 
            It is a competition where you read books beforehand and answer questions. I usually like to wear black. 
            Fun fact, most people call me Thursday (the rip-off of Wednesday). 
            I was in the path of totality for the solar eclipse; the sad part is I didn't have solar eclipse glasses. 
            I love art; it's just so graceful. I'm also pretty good at coding. If you want to learn more, check out my coding projects and I'll be happy to collaborate to make some cool stuff !

        <!-- add more details about your school, about your fav subject and your competetions that you had participated in. -->
        <!-- Make it atleast more 3-4 lines of info about yourself -->
